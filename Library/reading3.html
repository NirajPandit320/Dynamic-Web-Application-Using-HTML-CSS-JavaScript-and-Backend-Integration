        <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1><br><br>
        <h2>Start Your Day with a Task Completed</h2>
        <p>
            
            The barracks at basic SEAL training is a nondescript three-story building
            located on the beach at Coronado, California, just one hundred yards from the
            Pacific Ocean. There is no air-conditioning in the building, and at night, with the
            windows open, you can hear the tide roll in and the surf pounding against the
            sand. <br><br>
            Rooms in the barracks are spartan. In the officers’ room, where I berthed
            with three other classmates, there were four beds, a closet to hang your uniforms,
            and nothing else. Those mornings that I stayed in the barracks I would roll out of
            my Navy “rack” and immediately begin the process of making my bed. It was
            the first task of the day. A day that I knew would be filled with uniform
            inspections, long swims, longer runs, obstacle courses, and constant harassment
            from the SEAL instructors. <br><br>
            “Attention!” shouted the class leader, Lieutenant Junior Grade Dan’l
            Steward, as the instructor entered the room. Standing at the foot of the bed, I
            snapped my heels together and stood up straight as a chief petty officer
            approached my position. The instructor, stern and expressionless, began the
            inspection by checking the starch in my green uniform hat to ensure the eight￾sided “cover” was crisp and correctly blocked. Moving from top to bottom, his
            eyes looked over every inch of my uniform. Were the creases in the blouse and
            trousers aligned? Was the brass on the belt shined to a mirrorlike radiance? Were
            my boots polished bright enough so he could see his fingers in their reflection?
            Satisfied that I met the high standards expected of a SEAL trainee, he moved to
            inspect the bed.<br><br>
            The bed was as simple as the room, nothing but a steel frame and a single
            mattress. A bottom sheet covered the mattress, and over that was a top sheet. A
            gray wool blanket tucked tightly under the mattress provided warmth from the
            cool San Diego evenings. A second blanket was expertly folded into a rectangle
            at the foot of the bed. A single pillow, made by the Lighthouse for the Blind,
            was centered at the top of the bed and intersected at a ninety-degree angle with
            the blanket at the bottom. This was the standard. Any deviation from this
            exacting requirement would be cause for me to “hit the surf” and then roll
            around on the beach until I was covered head to toe with wet sand—referred to
            as a “sugar cookie.”<br><br>
            Standing motionless, I could see the instructor out of the corner of my eye.
            He wearily looked at my bed. Bending over, he checked the hospital corners and
            then surveyed the blanket and the pillow to ensure they were correctly aligned.
            Then, reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a quarter and flipped it into the air
            several times to ensure I knew the final test of the bed was coming. With one
            final flip the quarter flew high into the air and came down on the mattress with a
            light bounce. It jumped several inches off the bed, high enough for the instructor
            to catch it in his hand.<br><br>
            Swinging around to face me, the instructor looked me in the eye and nodded.
            He never said a word. Making my bed correctly was not going to be an
            opportunity for praise. It was expected of me. It was my first task of the day, and
            doing it right was important. It demonstrated my discipline. It showed my
            attention to detail, and at the end of the day it would be a reminder that I had
            done something well, something to be proud of, no matter how small the task.
            Throughout my life in the Navy, making my bed was the one constant that I
            could count on every day. As a young SEAL ensign aboard the USS Grayback, a
            special operation submarine, I was berthed in sick bay, where the beds were
            stacked four high. The salty old doctor who ran sick bay insisted that I make my
            rack every morning. He often remarked that if the beds were not made and the
            room was not clean, how could the sailors expect the best medical care? As I
            later found out, this sentiment of cleanliness and order applied to every aspect of
            military life.<br><br>
            Thirty years later, the Twin Towers came down in New York City. The
            Pentagon was struck, and brave Americans died in an airplane over
            Pennsylvania.<br><br>
            At the time of the attacks, I was recuperating in my home from a serious
            parachute accident. A hospital bed had been wheeled into my government
            quarters, and I spent most of the day lying on my back, trying to recover. I
            wanted out of that bed more than anything else. Like every SEAL I longed to be
            with my fellow warriors in the fight.<br><br>
            When I was finally well enough to lift myself unaided from the bed, the first
            thing I did was pull the sheets up tight, adjust the pillow, and make sure the
            hospital bed looked presentable to all those who entered my home. It was my
            way of showing that I had conquered the injury and was moving forward with
            my life.<br><br>
            Within four weeks of 9/11, I was transferred to the White House, where I
            spent the next two years in the newly formed Office of Combatting Terrorism.
            By October 2003, I was in Iraq at our makeshift headquarters on the Baghdad
            airfield. For the first few months we slept on Army cots. Nevertheless, I would
            wake every morning, roll up my sleeping bag, place the pillow at the head of the
            cot, and get ready for the day.<br><br>
            In December 2003, U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein. He was held in
            confinement during which time we kept him in a small room. He also slept on an
            Army cot, but with the luxury of sheets and a blanket. Once a day I would visit
            Saddam to ensure my soldiers were properly caring for him. I noticed, with some
            sense of amusement, that Saddam did not make his bed. The covers were always
            crumpled at the foot of his cot and he rarely seemed inclined to straighten them.
            During the ensuing ten years, I had the honor of working with some of the
            finest men and women this nation has ever produced—from generals to privates,
            from admirals to seamen recruits, from ambassadors to clerk typists. The
            Americans who deployed overseas in support of the war effort came willingly,
            sacrificing much to protect this great nation.<br><br>
            They all understood that life is hard and that sometimes there is little you can
            do to affect the outcome of your day. In battle soldiers die, families grieve, your
            days are long and filled with anxious moments. You search for something that
            can give you solace, that can motivate you to begin your day, that can be a sense
            of pride in an oftentimes ugly world. But it is not just combat. It is daily life that
            needs this same sense of structure. Nothing can replace the strength and comfort
            of one’s faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the
            lift you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right.
            If you want to change your life and maybe the world—start off by making
            your bed!
