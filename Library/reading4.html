        <h1>Myth No. 1:</h1>
        <h2>Your Brain Rests While You Sleep</h2>
        <p>
            

While it seems logical for the brain and body to rest during sleep
couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, the brain is in an oscil
state during sleep. Instead of hitting the “power off” button and every
shutting down, imagine the brain entering a hibernation state. Whil
bodies get to rest and recuperate at night, our brain runs backgr
processes and goes into housekeeping mode. Its job now is to kee
body’s systems in good shape and make sure everything is run
smoothly.
Now, this happens because the sleep phase occurs in five diff
stages. The first four stages are collectively called “slow-wave sl
This is when our bodies enter the deepest, most serene state. The
stage is known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or “dream sle
This is the most active sleep stage, and although most of our bo

record electrical-brainwave activity in the brain, eyes, and mus
Despite everything else being shut down, these areas of the brai
show activity when we enter the sleep phase.
Accordingly, when we go to bed and wind down for sleep, our 
prepares for this restorative phase. It works in intervals of roughl
minute cycles, working through the sleep stages described above.
During the first 30 minutes of the onset of sleep, we enter stages
and two. This is the introduction phase, where our bodies’ int
systems are winding down. Here, things like heart rate get reduced
muscle tone relaxes. It’s important to note that this is the lightest fo
sleep in this phase.
In the next half hour, we enter stages three and four. This is know
the “deep sleep” phase, which is often associated with synchro
slow-wave sleep activity. Here in non-REM deep sleep, the brain m
regulates the physical side of things: energy conservation occurs i
body, and the autonomic system maintains balance during this time, 
as clearing up the toxic buildup of waste chemicals like free radicals
oxidative stress.
After 60 minutes or so have passed, we finally enter the REM 
stage. This dream sleep allows us to regulate emotional processes
reflect on what has happened throughout the day; hence, learning
memory formation are primarily related to this stage (Siegel, 2005).
So, throughout the 90-minute sleep cycle, we have drifted from s
one to REM sleep. But it doesn’t stop there. As the first cycle comes
close, our brains and bodies oscillate back down from the REM 
stage to stage one of slow-wave sleep, and this repeats throughout 
successive sleep cycle. On average, we experience four to six 
cycles a night (Patel et al., 2022). In the first half of these cycles,
mainly experience deep sleep. Then, as we experience the second
of the cycles, we’ll drift more into experiencing longer durations of 
sleep. Both periods of the night are critical since it’s only the comb
experience of deep sleep and REM sleep that ensures a restor
night’s rest.
It’s also important to note that I’ve simplified things by saying that the
four stages of non-REM sleep keep your body working and that the 
sleep stage helps you process your emotions. In reality, both st
maintain physical and mental function throughout our bodies.
example, growth hormone and testosterone production are mainta
during the REM sleep stage.
There you have it! Our bodies may be resting in place, but our brain
maintaining law and order. By revealing the inner machinations o
sleep phase, I hope it highlights how important this one-third of our
is for our longevity
