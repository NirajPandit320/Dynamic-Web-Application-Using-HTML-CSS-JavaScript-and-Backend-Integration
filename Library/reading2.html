        <h1>Chapter 1.</h1>
        <h2>Ugh, Small Talk</h2>
        <p>
            
            Human beings are a social species. Connection is crucial to happiness,
            staving off depression, and keeping healthy—literally. Various studies have
            shown that the effects of loneliness are akin to eating a poorer diet and
            exercising less, and can ultimately lead to the same place—an early death. <br><br>
            It might sound a little melodramatic, but companionship is literally the way
            our brains have been built to survive and thrive. <br><br>
            But for the purposes of this book’s topic, there’s an even more important
            wrinkle: the quality of our interactions matters as well, not just the quantity
            or presence of other people around us. Sounds like even our brains despise
            small talk. <br><br>
            A 2010 study by Matthias Mehl had participants wandering around in their
            daily lives armed with a device that would record their audio environment
            over three days. The researchers analyzed how long each participant was in
            the presence of other people, and whether they were having casual
            conversations or were talking about more substantive matters. Basically, the
            aim was to capture what kinds of interactions these participants were taking
            part in, and the effect they had on their lives. <br><br>
            At the same time, the researchers also measured people’s overall level of
            happiness and mental and physical well-being. They found a clear
            correlation between substantive and deep discussions and greater well￾being and happiness. It’s something you’ve probably suspected or even felt
            before, but being vulnerable and open with others is a deeply satisfying
            activity on many levels. <br><br>
            As for small talk, that which is the opposite of substance and depth? Well, it
            drew a negative correlation with well-being and happiness, meaning it made
            people less happy. There you have it; real evidence that small talk is
            something to be avoided, or at least transition out of as quickly as possible.
            Researcher Arthur Aron conducted a study in 1997, in which he paired
            participants who didn’t know each other and gave them a list of fairly
            personal questions to ask. Although the questions were not offensively
            intrusive, they were more than just small talk. (“Would you like to be
            famous and how?” “Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?”
            “What is your most terrible memory?” “How do you feel about your
            relationship with your mother?”) <br><br>
            Aron found that the participants responded to these “deep dives” with
            openness and intimacy. The participants didn’t feel that the questions, as
            personal as they were, necessarily invaded their privacy or weakened them
            in any way. Instead, these questions encouraged honesty, more emotional
            fluency, and sincerity in the respondents. They felt closer to the other
            participants, who were complete strangers before the experiment. Future
            iterations of this study were given names such as “How to fall in love with
            36 questions” because of the powerful effects it had on the relationships
            between the participants, which were previously nonexistent. <br><br>
            You probably already know deep in your bones what these two studies laid
            out: delving more deeply or intensely in our communications can create
            positive results far more swiftly than one might think. Now the question
            remains: how can we actually do that? In this book, I want to provide a
            framework, from beginning to end, about how to engage people more
            effectively and move beyond small talk. We’ll start even before the
            interaction begins with how you should prepare yourself, and move on
            through all the stages of small talk to arrive at something more meaningful. <br><br>
            At the prospect of reading this book, you might be overly excited about
            throwing yourself into the midst of a conversation and seeing what you can
            accomplish. After all, you’re reading this book for a reason, and motivation
            can make you overeager—but rushing in would be a mistake for the time
            being. It would be akin to running into battle without your shield, sword, or
            even pants.
