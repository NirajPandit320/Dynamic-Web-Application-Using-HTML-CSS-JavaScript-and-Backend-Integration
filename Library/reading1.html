        <br><br><br><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><br><br>
        <p>
            
            DO YOU WANT TO IMPROVE an important aspect of your life? Perhaps
            lose weight, find your perfect partner, obtain your dream job, or simply
            be happier? Try this simple exercise. …<br>
            Close your eyes and imagine the new you. Think how great you would
            look in those close-fitting designer jeans, dating Brad Pitt or Angelina
            Jolie, sitting in a luxurious leather chair at the top of the corporate
            ladder, or sipping a piña colada as the warm waves of the Caribbean
            gently lap at your feet. <br>
            The good news is that this type of exercise has been recommended by
            some in the self-help industry for years. The bad news is that a large
            body of research now suggests that such exercises are, at best, ineffective
            and, at worst, harmful. Although imagining your perfect self may make
            you feel better, engaging in such mental escapism can also have the
            unfortunate side effect of leaving you unprepared for the difficulties that
            crop up on the rocky road to success, thus increasing the chances of your
            faltering at the first hurdle rather than persisting in the face of failure.
            Fantasizing about heaven on earth may put a smile on your face, but it is
            unlikely to help transform your dreams into reality. <br>
            Other research suggests that the same goes for many popular
            techniques that claim to improve your life. Attempting to “think yourself
            happy” by suppressing negative thoughts can make you obsess on the
            very thing that makes you unhappy. Group brainstorming can produce
            fewer and less original ideas than individuals working alone. Punching a
            pillow and screaming out loud can increase, rather than decrease, your
            anger and stress levels. <br>
            Then there is the infamous “Yale Goal Study.” According to some
            writers, in 1953 a team of researchers interviewed Yale’s graduating
            seniors, asking them whether they had written down the specific goals
            that they wanted to achieve in life. Twenty years later the researchers
            tracked down the same cohort and found that the 3 percent of people
            who had specific goals all those years before had accumulated more
            personal wealth than the other 97 percent of their classmates combined.
            It is a great story, frequently cited in self-help books and seminars to
            illustrate the power of goal setting. There is just one small problem—as
            far as anyone can tell, the experiment never actually took place. In 2007
            writer Lawrence Tabak, from the magazine Fast Company, attempted to
            track down the study, contacting several writers who had cited it, the
            secretary of the Yale Class of 1953, and other researchers who had tried
            to discover whether the study had actually happened.1 No one could
            produce any evidence that it had ever been conducted, causing Tabak to
            conclude that it was almost certainly nothing more than an urban myth.
            For years, self-help gurus had been happy to describe a study without
            checking their facts. <br>
            Both the public and the business world have bought into modern-day
            mind myths for years and, in so doing, may have significantly decreased
            the likelihood of achieving their aims and ambitions. Worse still, such
            failure often encourages people to believe that they cannot control their
            lives. This is especially unfortunate, as even the smallest loss of
            perceived control can have a dramatic effect on people’s confidence,
            happiness, and life span. In one classic study conducted by Ellen Langer
            at Harvard University, half of the residents in a nursing home were given
            a houseplant and asked to look after it, while the other residents were
            given an identical plant but told that the staff would take responsibility
            for it.2 Six months later, the residents who had been robbed of even this
            small amount of control over their lives were significantly less happy,
            healthy, and active than the others. Even more distressing, 30 percent of
            the residents who had not looked after their plant had died, compared to
            15 percent of those who had been allowed to exercise such control.
            Similar results have been found in many areas, including education,
            career, health, relationships, and dieting. The message is clear—those
            who do not feel in control of their lives are less successful, and less
            psychologically and physically healthy, than those who do feel in
            control. <br>
            A few years ago I was having lunch with a friend named Sophie.
            Sophie is a bright, successful thirtysomething who holds a senior
            position in a firm of management consultants. Over lunch Sophie
            explained that she had recently bought a well-known book on increasing
            happiness, and she asked me what I thought of the industry. I explained
            that I had serious reservations about the scientific backing for some of
            the techniques being promoted, and described how any failure to change
            could do considerable psychological harm. Sophie looked concerned and
            then asked whether academic psychology had produced more
            scientifically supported ways of improving people’s lives. I started to
            describe some of the quite complex academic work in happiness, and
            after about fifteen minutes or so Sophie stopped me. She politely
            explained that interesting though it was, she was a busy person, and she
            asked whether I could come up with some effective advice that didn’t
            take quite so much time to implement. I asked how long I had. Sophie
            glanced at her watch, smiled, and replied, “About a minute?” <br>
            Sophie’s comment made me stop and think. Many people are attracted
            to self-development and self-improvement because of the lure of quick
            and easy solutions to various issues in their lives. Unfortunately, most
            academic psychology either fails to address these issues or presents far
            more time-consuming and complex answers (thus the scene in Woody
            Allen’s film Sleeper, in which Allen’s character discovers that he has
            awakened two hundred years in the future, sighs, and explains that had
            he been in therapy all this time he would almost be cured). I wondered
            whether there were tips and techniques hidden away in academic
            journals that were empirically supported but quick to carry out.
            Over the course of a few months I carefully searched through endless
            journals containing research papers from many different areas of
            psychology. As I examined the work, a promising pattern emerged, with
            researchers in quite different fields developing techniques that help
            people achieve their aims and ambitions in minutes, not months. I
            collected hundreds of these studies, drawn from many different areas of
            the behavioral sciences. From mood to memory, persuasion to
            procrastination, resilience to relationships, together they represent a new
            science of rapid change. <br>
            There is a very old story, often told to fill time during training courses,
            involving a man trying to fix his broken boiler. Despite his best efforts
            over many months, he simply can’t mend it. Eventually, he gives up and
            decides to call in an expert. The engineer arrives, gives one gentle tap on
            the side of the boiler, and stands back as it springs to life. The engineer
            presents the man with a bill, and the man argues that he should pay only
            a small fee as the job took the engineer only a few moments. The
            engineer quietly explains that the man is not paying for the time he took
            to tap the boiler but rather the years of experience involved in knowing
            exactly where to tap. Just like the expert engineer tapping the boiler, the
            techniques described in this book demonstrate that effective change does
            not have to be time-consuming. In fact, it can take less than a minute
            and is often simply a question of knowing exactly where to tap.
